# TECH_INTERN23
# C / C++ PROGRAMMING
This repository is made as per instructions given in TECH INTERN for submission of TASKs.


## LEVEL 1
Write a C or C++ code to implement quick sort, heap sort, shell sort, tree sort.


## LEVEL 2
Write C or C++ code to implement dijkstra algorithm, kruskal algorithm and prim's algorithm in graph.


## LEVEL 3
Assume that you have an array of integers and you want to find the second-largest element in the array. Write a C++ or C program to do this in a single pass without sorting the array.


## LEVEL 4
Assume that you have a binary search tree (BST) with unique integer values stored in each node. Write a C++ or C program to find the maximum width of the tree, which is the maximum number of nodes that can appear at any level in the tree. The program should have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.


## LEVEL 5
Assume that you are developing a game in which players can control different characters, such as warriors, archers, and mages. Each character has a set of abilities that they can use during gameplay. Write a C++ program to model this game using object-oriented programming concepts. The program should have the
following classes:

A. Character: This class should have attributes such as name, health, and level, as well as a virtual function for using abilities.

B. Warrior, Archer, and Mage: These classes should inherit from the Character class and have their own unique abilities.

C. Ability: This class should have attributes such as name, damage, and mana cost, as well as a virtual function for executing the ability.

The program should allow the player to create and control different characters, select and use abilities during gameplay, and display the current status of the game.
